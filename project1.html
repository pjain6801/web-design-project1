       <h3>How search engines work?</h3>
       <p>Search engines have two main parts, crawling and indexing and providing answers. Search engines “crawl” or comb
         through documents, media files, links, websites, pages, and etc to find content that is relevant. Then it orders 
         the content by popularity. This is then relayed as the output which is the “providing answers” part of a 
         search engine process.</p>
   
       <h3>The importance of keywords and descriptions as meta tags</h3>
       <p>Meta tags like keywords and descriptions are important for a few main reasons. One reason is for the SEO (search engine optimization),
        to help it understand the content of the page which will in turn help in ranking the results. Adding keywords
         and descriptions will make the page more visible and easier to be found. Another reason meta tags are important is 
         because it plays a role in the user experience because it provides a clear understanding to the user what 
         the website is about.</p>
   
       <h3>Four elements that comprise writing relevant content links</h3>
       <p>One element that plays a part is anchor texts, which are the texts that are hyperlinks to other pages. These links should
         tell the user what they will find at the other link, what it is about. Another element that comprises writing relevant 
         content links is the content that surrounds the link. The content should contain information about why the links are included 
         and what the link is about. The last elements are relevance, the links must be relevant and quality (high quality leads to
          more value to the users).  
      </p>
   
       <h3>What constitutes good heading hierarchy and include an example with more than one heading tag</h3>
       <p>Good heading hierarchy is when you have multiple heading but they are in order by size. For example, the main heading 
        would be the biggest size and each smaller heading would be considered a subheading. An example of this is the page, the
         biggest heading is the text “CMST 386 - Project 1” then each heading after, the questions are a smaller size. All of the
         question headings are the same size because they are all of the same category, questions.
